GTSMART Code Editor for OpenAI
Creating a full-fledged React app for code editing, file navigation, and output display is beyond the scope of this text interface, but I can provide you with a high-level guide on how you could approach building this application.

You can break down this problem into three main components:

Code Editing Panel

File Navigation Panel

Output Display Panel

Code Editing Panel
